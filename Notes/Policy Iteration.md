Policy iteration is an iterative algorithm used in the field of dynamic programming to find the optimal policy for a given [[Markov Decision Process]] (MDP) in the context of static decision making. MDPs are mathematical models used to describe decision-making problems in which an agent interacts with an environment to achieve a goal.

In static decision making, the environment is considered stationary, meaning its behavior doesn't change over time. The goal is to find the best policy (a strategy or plan) that the agent can follow to maximize a specific objective, such as maximizing expected rewards.

## Step-by-step process

Here's a step-by-step explanation of policy iteration:

1. **Initialization**: 
    
    - Start with an initial policy, which can be a random policy or an arbitrarily chosen one.
    
1. **Policy Evaluation**:
    
    - Evaluate the current policy to determine its value, which is the expected cumulative reward the agent can obtain when following that policy. This involves solving a set of linear equations or using iterative methods like the Bellman equation.
    
1. **Policy Improvement**:
    
    - Update the policy to be more greedy with respect to the current value function. In other words, improve the policy by selecting actions that maximize the expected cumulative reward based on the current value function.
    
1. **Convergence Check**:
    
    - Check if the policy has converged to the optimal policy. This can be done by comparing the new policy with the previous one or by checking the change in policy values.
    
1. **Iteration**:
    
    - If the policy has not converged, repeat steps 2-4. Go back to step 2 using the updated policy, and continue the iteration until the policy converges to the optimal policy.

## Usage

Policy iteration guarantees convergence to the optimal policy in a finite number of steps for finite MDPs under certain conditions. It alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement, refining the policy iteratively until it reaches the optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward in the given MDP.

Overall, policy iteration is a fundamental algorithm for solving static decision-making problems in the context of Markov decision processes.
