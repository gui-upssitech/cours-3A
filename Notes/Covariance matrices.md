### 1D Variance

Given a normal distribution, the variance will show based on the width of the curve. We can say that we can be confident a sample taken from the distribution will be within $2\sigma$ of mean.

### Shape of a 2D covariance

> [!tip]
> Imagine a covariance ellipsis as a 2D projection of a 3D normal curve.

If all the state elements are independant, the covariance ellipsis will be straight.

If there some dependance between the elements of the state, the covariance ellipsis will be slanted.
