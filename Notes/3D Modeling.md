## Iterative Closest Point (ICP)

Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is an algorithm used in computer vision and robotics to align two or more 3D point clouds or shapes. The goal of ICP is to find the best transformation (e.g., translation, rotation, scaling) that minimizes the difference between two sets of points, usually referred to as the "source" and "target" point clouds.
