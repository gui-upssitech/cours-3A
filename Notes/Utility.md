The utility function $u(x)$ determines the attractivity of the consequence $x$ for the DM.
If $u(x) > u(x')$ then $x$ is preferred to $x'$. 

### Expected utility (EU)

Expected Utility (EU) is a concept derived from decision theory and economics. It is a measure of the value an individual associates with a particular outcome or action, weighted by the probability of that outcome. In other words, EU combines the benefits or expected values of an action with the probabilities associated with those benefits to calculate the overall expected value of the action.

### Lower Expected Utility (LEU) and Upper Expected Utility (UEU):

**Lower Expected Utility (LEU):** This is the utility calculated considering the worst-case scenario or the least desirable outcome. When a person makes a decision, they take into account the least favorable outcome and calculate the EU based on that outcome.

**Upper Expected Utility (UEU):** This is the utility calculated considering the best-case scenario or the most desirable outcome. When a person makes a decision, they take into account the most favorable outcome and calculate the EU based on that outcome.


The LEU and UEU provide a comprehensive perspective on the potential pros and cons of a decision or action, considering the most pessimistic and most optimistic scenarios. This allows for a more balanced and informed evaluation of the decision.

In summary, EU is a way to assess the expected value of an action, taking into account the probabilities of different possible outcomes, while LEU and UEU help evaluate the worst and best possible scenarios associated with that action.
