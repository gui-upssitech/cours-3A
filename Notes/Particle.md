In particle filtering, a "particle" is not a physical particle like an atom or subatomic particle but a concept used to represent possible states or hypotheses about the internal state of a dynamic system.

Each particle is a specific point in the state space of the dynamic system. This state includes all the relevant variables and parameters that describe the system's current or future condition. For example, in a robot localization problem, each particle might represent a possible position and orientation of the robot.
