# Key terms

**Nature** typically refers to the external environment, circumstances, or events that are beyond the control of the decision maker (DM). Nature represents the uncertainty and variability in the outcomes or consequences associated with different choices or actions made by the decision maker.

The **Decision maker** (DM) is an individual, entity, or system responsible for making a decision based on available information, preferences, and objectives. The DM evaluates the possible outcomes associated with different choices and selects the most appropriate course of action based on their goals, preferences, risk tolerance, and the probabilities of different outcomes as perceived or estimated from the perspective of Nature.
