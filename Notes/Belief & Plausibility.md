## Belief Function

A belief function represents the degree of belief or support for a particular proposition or event. It quantifies the belief an agent has in the occurrence of an event, considering the available evidence. The belief function assigns a value to each possible event, reflecting the strength of belief in that event. The sum of the belief values for all events within the frame of discernment (the set of all possible events) is typically less than or equal to 1.

## Plausibility Function

The plausibility function complements the belief function and provides an upper bound on belief. It represents the highest degree of belief an agent is willing to assign to an event, considering the available evidence. It quantifies how plausible an event is without necessarily implying a strong belief in its occurrence.

The relationship between belief and plausibility is as follows:
- $Bel(A)â‰¤Pl(A)$ for all events $A$ in $X$.

Belief and plausibility functions are essential in decision making under uncertainty as they allow for the representation of partial beliefs and the consideration of uncertainty when evaluating different options or making choices.

In static decision making, belief and plausibility functions can be used to assess the likelihood and plausibility of various outcomes or events, aiding in rational decision-making processes, especially when dealing with incomplete or uncertain information.
